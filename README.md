📱 Smartphone Recommender System

This project focuses on building a data-driven smartphone recommender system using real-world scraped smartphone specifications.

The current phase of the project covers data cleaning and preprocessing for machine learning, including price normalization, availability handling, launch date processing, and feature preparation. The dataset is designed with a clear separation between raw data, EDA/ML-ready data, and UI-oriented data to ensure scalability and reproducibility.

Future stages will include:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering

Recommendation logic (rule-based + ML)

Explainable AI-driven user interaction

The goal of this project is to create a decision-support system that helps users choose the most suitable smartphone based on their preferences, rather than simply listing multiple options.
